# Best Practices for AI Governance

Implementing effective AI governance requires combining technical controls with organizational practices. These best practices will help you maximize security benefits while maintaining developer productivity in AI-assisted workflows.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### **1. Security by Default**
Configure Codeward to catch security issues without manual intervention:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "dependency_tree": true  // Enable comprehensive analysis
  },
  "vulnerability": [{
    "name": "Default security baseline",
    "actions": {
      "new": "block",      // Prevent new critical issues
      "existing": "warn",  // Track existing issues for remediation
      "removed": "info"    // Celebrate improvements
    },
    "rules": {
      "severity": [{"type": "eq", "value": "CRITICAL"}]
    }
  }]
}
```

### **2. Progressive Enhancement**
Start with basic policies and gradually increase coverage:

```json
{
  "vulnerability": [
    {
      "name": "Phase 1: Critical only",
      "action": "block",
      "rules": {"severity": [{"type": "eq", "value": "CRITICAL"}]}
    },
    {
      "name": "Phase 2: High severity",
      "action": "warn",  // Will become "block" later
      "rules": {"severity": [{"type": "eq", "value": "HIGH"}]}
    }
  ]
}
```

### **3. Developer Experience First**
Ensure security measures enhance rather than hinder development:

- **Clear Error Messages**: Provide actionable feedback
- **Fast Feedback Loops**: Integrate with CI/CD for immediate results
- **Educational Content**: Include security guidance in scan results

## 🏗️ Organizational Best Practices

### **Team Structure & Responsibilities**

**Security Champions Program:**
- Designate security-aware developers in each team
- Provide advanced Codeward training
- Empower champions to refine policies

**Clear Ownership:**
```yaml
# RACI Matrix for AI Security Governance
Policy Creation: Security Team (R), Engineering Leads (A), Developers (C)
Policy Updates: Security Champions (R), Security Team (A), Teams (I)
Violation Response: Developers (R), Security Champions (A), Security Team (C)
Metrics Review: Engineering Leads (R), Security Team (A), Management (I)
```

### **Policy Lifecycle Management**

**1. Policy Development Process:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Identify Risk] --> B[Draft Policy]
    B --> C[Team Review]
    C --> D[Pilot Testing]
    D --> E[Production Deployment]
    E --> F[Monitor & Refine]
    F --> A
```

**2. Change Management:**
```json
{
  "policy_metadata": {
    "version": "1.2.0",
    "last_updated": "2025-09-07",
    "review_date": "2025-12-07",
    "owner": "security-team",
    "change_log": [
      "Added medium severity blocking",
      "Refined license policies"
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Training & Education**

**Developer Onboarding:**
1. **AI Security Awareness**: Risks specific to AI-assisted development
2. **Codeward Training**: How to interpret and act on scan results
3. **Policy Familiarization**: Understanding team-specific security policies
4. **Remediation Workflows**: Standard procedures for fixing security issues

**Ongoing Education:**
- Monthly security newsletters with real examples
- Quarterly policy review meetings
- Annual security training updates
- Incident post-mortems with learning outcomes

## 🔧 Technical Best Practices

### **Configuration Management**

**Version Control for Policies:**
```bash
# Store configurations in version control
git add config.json
git commit -m "feat: add license compliance policies"
git push origin main
```

**Environment-Specific Configurations:**
```json
{
  "environments": {
    "development": {
      "vulnerability": [{"action": "warn"}]
    },
    "staging": {
      "vulnerability": [{"action": "block"}]
    },
    "production": {
      "vulnerability": [{"action": "block"}],
      "validation": [/* Additional prod-specific rules */]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Integration Patterns**

**GitHub Actions Best Practices:**
```yaml
name: Comprehensive Security Scan
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15  # Reasonable timeout
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for accurate diff analysis
          
      - name: Security Scan
        uses: codeward-io/scan@v0.0.1
        with:
          event: ${{ github.event_name }}
          repository: ${{ github.repository }}
          current_branch: ${{ github.ref }}
          pr_number: ${{ github.event.number }}
```

**Multi-Repository Management:**
```json
{
  "shared_policies": {
    "critical_vulnerabilities": {
      "action": "block",
      "rules": {"severity": [{"type": "eq", "value": "CRITICAL"}]}
    }
  },
  "repository_overrides": {
    "experimental-projects": {
      "vulnerability": [{"action": "warn"}]  // More lenient for experiments
    },
    "production-services": {
      "vulnerability": [
        {"action": "block", "severity": "CRITICAL"},
        {"action": "block", "severity": "HIGH"}  // Stricter for production
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Performance Optimization**

**Scan Optimization:**
```json
{
  "global": {
    "dependency_tree": false,  // Disable for faster scans if not needed
    "ignore": {
      "paths": ["node_modules/", "vendor/", ".git/"],
      "files": ["*.test.js", "*.spec.ts"],
      "file_extensions": [".log", ".tmp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Caching Strategy:**
```yaml
- name: Cache scan results
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/codeward-scan
    key: scan-cache-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json', '**/go.sum') }}
    restore-keys: scan-cache-
```

```json
{
  "incident_response": {
    "P0": {
      "notification": ["security-team", "engineering-leads", "management"],
      "timeline": "immediate",
      "action": "emergency-patch"
    },
    "P1": {
      "notification": ["security-team", "engineering-leads"],
      "timeline": "24-hours",
      "action": "priority-patch"
    }
  }
}
```

### **Emergency Workflows**

**Hotfix Process:**
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Severity and impact evaluation
2. **Bypass Authorization**: Temporary policy override if needed
3. **Rapid Development**: Focused fix implementation
