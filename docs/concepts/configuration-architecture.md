# Deprecated: Configuration Architecture

This legacy page has been superseded by consolidated references:

- Core flow & components: [Architecture](./architecture.md)
- Conceptual configuration overview: [Configuration Overview](../configuration/overview.md)
- Detailed schema reference: [Main Config Reference](../configuration/main-config.md)
- Style & naming conventions: [Style & Naming Guide](../configuration/style-naming-guide.md)

The previous duplicate content (principles, schema snippets, environment variables, best practices) now lives in those canonical pages to reduce redundancy.

If you followed an old link or bookmark, update it to point at the references above.

---
Rationale: Removing duplicated configuration prose prevents drift and keeps a single authoritative location for each concept.
